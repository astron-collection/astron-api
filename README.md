# Astron API

The **Astron API** is the backend foundation of the Astron Collection — a suite of powerful, open-source Discord applications designed for community management, automation, and more. Built with TypeScript, this API serves data to the Astron ecosystem and powers real-time integrations with Discord bots and web clients.

## 🚀 Features

- RESTful and WebSocket support
- Real-time project statistics
- Plugin-ready architecture
- Authentication and permission layers
- Built-in support for dynamic bot data
- Developer-friendly and fully documented

## 📦 Tech Stack

- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Runtime**: Node.js
- **Framework**: Express or Fastify (depending on version)
- **Database**: JSON-based (initial) or optionally MongoDB/PostgreSQL
- **WebSockets**: Socket.IO or native implementation

## 🛠️ Setup

```bash
# Clone the project
git clone https://github.com/astron-collection/astron-api.git
cd api

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start in development mode
npm run dev
````

## 🔧 Scripts

| Script          | Description                     |
| --------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `npm run dev`   | Run the API in development mode |
| `npm run build` | Compile the project to `/dist`  |
| `npm run start` | Run the compiled version        |

## 📁 Project Structure

```
/src
  /routes      → API routes
  /controllers → Logic handling for each route
  /services    → Shared services (ex: bot stats, auth)
  /utils       → Helpers and utilities
  /config      → App configuration and constants
  /data        → JSON data or database models
```

## 🔐 Authentication

The API supports authentication via:

* Bearer tokens (for internal usage)
* API keys (for plugin integrations)
* Webhook tokens (optional)

## 📊 Real-Time Features

The API is capable of pushing live data to clients (like Astron GUI) through:

* WebSocket events
* Custom JSON endpoints
* Plugin interfaces

## 🧩 Plugins Support (Upcoming)

The Astron API will allow developers to register and expose their own plugin endpoints via a modular architecture. A CLI and SDK will be provided for easier integration.
